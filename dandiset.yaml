description: 'Compulsive behavior is a defining feature of disorders such as substance
  use disorders. Current evidence

  suggests that corticostriatal circuits control the expression of established compulsions,
  but little is known

  about the mechanisms regulating the development of compulsions. We hypothesized
  that dopamine, a critical modulator of striatal synaptic plasticity, could control
  alterations in corticostriatal circuits leading to the

  development of compulsions (defined here as continued reward seeking in the face
  of punishment). We used

  dual-site fiber photometry to measure dopamine axon activity in the dorsomedial
  striatum (DMS) and the

  dorsolateral striatum (DLS) as compulsions emerged. Individual variability in the
  speed with which compulsions emerged was predicted by DMS dopamine axon activity.
  Amplifying this dopamine signal accelerated

  animalsâ€™ transitions to compulsion, whereas inhibition delayed it. In contrast,
  amplifying DLS dopamine

  signaling had no effect on the emergence of compulsions. These results establish
  DMS dopamine signaling

  as a key controller of the development of compulsive reward seeking.'
